I haven't gotten around yet to writing a Makefile for this. Instead, run
the included script, "./build". You need the SDL, SDL_mixer, and SDL_ttf
libraries installed.

On Windows, this'll work under MinGW but you will probably want to add
the "-mwindows" option to the build script, to avoid the program making a
console window when it runs.
