>>SPRAY<<            v1.0

Originally made in about 14 hours on September 13, 2005.
This version released November 21, 2005.

Spray is a weird game.

You are an invisible entity that sprays colored specks, first in white,
then blue, then yellow. Another entity is also spraying, initially in
red. You must collide with the other entity as much as possible before
you finish turning yellow, thus ending the game.

Use the arrow keys for control. Your score -- based on how long and how
often you collided -- is displayed when the game ends. At that point you
can press Space to play again or Escape to quit.

Any feedback is welcome.
